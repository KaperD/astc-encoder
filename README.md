# About

Encoder and Decoder Tool for Evaluation of ARM Adaptive Scalable Texture Compression (ASTC).

The ASTC Evaluation Codec is a command-line executable that compresses and decompresses images using this texture compression standard.

Running on a standard PC, this tool allows content developers to evaluate the impressive quality and size benefits offered by this texture compression format, in advance of it being available in GPU  hardware.

# ASTC Features & Benefits

## Encoding

* Compression of PNG, TGA and KTX into ASTC format
* Control of bit rate from 0.89 bits/pixel upto 8bits/pixel in fine steps
* Control of compression time/quality tradeoff with exhaustive, thorough, medium, fast and very fast encoding speeds
* Supports both low (LDR) and high dynamic range (HDR) images
* Supports 3D texture compression
* Measure PSNR between input and output

## Decoding

* Decodes ASTC images to TGA or KTX

#  Package Contents

* Source code
* Full specification of the ASTC data format
* Binaries for Windows, Mac OS X and Linux (x86, 32-bit)
